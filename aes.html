    <h2>Decryption Example : Securing ATM PINs
</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Shared Key:</strong> The bank and the ATM machine share a secret DES key.</li>
      <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> When a customer enters their PIN, the ATM machine uses the shared DES key to encrypt the PIN before sending it over a network.</li>
      <li><strong>Decryption:</strong> The bank's system receives the encrypted PIN and uses the same shared secret DES key to decrypt it, verifying the customer's identity. </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Security and Modern Usage</h3>
    <p>DES is now considered insecure for most applications due to its short 56-bit key length, which can be broken by brute-force attacks with modern computing power. However, it was a foundational algorithm, influencing the development of more secure cryptographic standards like AES. 
    </p>

    <p>
     The Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm itself is no longer considered secure and is not used for new applications due to its weak 56-bit key length
