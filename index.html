    <h2>About DES</h2>
    <p>
      Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric block cipher. By 'symmetric', we mean that the size of input text and output text (ciphertext) is same (64-bits). The 'block' here means that it takes group of bits together as input instead of encrypting the text bit by bit. Data encryption standard (DES) has been found vulnerable to very powerful attacks and therefore, it was replaced by Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

    <h3>Key Features of AES</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Symmetric key algorithm (same key for encryption and decryption).</li>
      <li>Block cipher that operates on 128-bit blocks.</li>
      <li>Supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.</li>
      <li>Faster and more secure than DES.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      AES is used in applications like secure communications, 
      online banking, file encryption, and wireless security.
