    <h2>About AES</h2>
    <p>
      AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm 
      widely used across the globe to secure sensitive data. 
      It was established as a standard by the U.S. government in 2001, 
      replacing the older DES (Data Encryption Standard).
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features of AES</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Symmetric key algorithm (same key for encryption and decryption).</li>
      <li>Block cipher that operates on 128-bit blocks.</li>
      <li>Supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.</li>
      <li>Faster and more secure than DES.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      AES is used in applications like secure communications, 
      online banking, file encryption, and wireless security.
